# Explain a project that you have built?
**Answer->**  One of the best projects was to clone a website called gaana.com. This website was about a music website. We were a group of two members. First, we divided our responsibility and worked accordingly. I was leading the project and created the basic structure of the project like navbar and their functionalities. I worked hard on this project because my team member was a working person and he contributed only two pages and a footer part. I used HTML to design the basic skeleton of the website, CSS to beautify it, and Javascript to make it work dynamically as a real website. I also used GitHub to track the progress of a project and code collaboration. I learned many new javascript and git concepts. During this project, I made my HTML, CSS and JavaScript perfect. I mostly learned how to coordinate with our team members effectively. As a result, I received very good feedback from our mentors and won third rank prize on my project gaana.com amongst 12 teams.
